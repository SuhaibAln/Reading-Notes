# Readings: SQL database, ORM, Sequelize

 # whats the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
 > SQL databases are relational databases, while NoSQL databases are non-relational databases. SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based

# what is sequelize and how to use it with node.js?
> Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.

# what is an ORM how does it work, and how should I use one?
> Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.

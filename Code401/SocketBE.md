# What the OSI model is
- General model of communication, not specific to any one technology or protocol

# The purpose of each of the 7 layers
- Physical:Binary transmission of data
- Data Link:Transmission of data between two devices
- Network:Transmission of data between two networks
- Transport:Transmission of data between two applications
- Session:Establishing, managing, and terminating connections
- Presentation:Data formatting and encryption
- Application:Application specific protocols

#The problems that can happen at each of the 7 layers
- Physical:Transmission errors, noise, interference
- Data Link:Frame errors, collisions, MAC addresses
- Network:Routing, IP addresses, packet loss
- Transport:Port numbers, congestion, packet loss
- Session:Connection management, session management
- Presentation:Data formatting, encryption
- Application:Application specific protocols

# The difference between TCP/IP model and the OSI model
- TCP/IP is a specific implementation of the OSI model
- TCP/IP is a set of protocols, not a model

# What Socket.IO is
- A library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server
It is built on top of the WebSocket protocol and provides additional guarantees like fallback to HTTP long-polling or automatic reconnection.

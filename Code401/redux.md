# Readings: Redux Basic


- Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- Redux is a state management library.
- not tied to react ,can be used with any other framework 
## Why Should I Use Redux?
- Redux helps you manage "global" state - state that is needed across many parts of your application.
- componets in react are independent of each other ,they can't share data with each other ,so we need a way to share data between components ,redux is a way to do that

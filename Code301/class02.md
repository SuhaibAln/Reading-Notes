# React: Component Lifecycle Events
> components can be defined as classes or functions ,lifescycle are  methods that we use in components and help during its lifecycle by updating UI and application states 

# Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
- The ‘render’ method is called first, and then the ‘componentDidMount’ method is called.

# What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
  Mounting is first thing that happens

# Put the following things in the order that they happen (componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates) 
1- constructor
2- render
3- componentDidMount
4- React Updates
5- componentWillUnmount

# What does componentDidMount do
to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, 


# What types of things can you pass in the props?
Arguments,data that I want  it to be displayed
# What is the big difference between props and state?
props can be passed into  a component and handled outside of a component and must be updated outside the component ,while
state is handled inside of that component and can be updated inside of component
# When do we re-render our application?
changing the state caused our application to re-render
# What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
data that is inputed by the user because this type of data is constatnly changing by the user

# 1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
## CRUD is the create/read/update/delete cycle - the four main ways to interact with databases. REST is a way of designing software that uses the HTTP protocol, often with functions similar to CRUD functions. REST APIs also have access to functions beyond CRUD.

# 2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
## - Define what information you're storing (photos, recipes, orders) & where you'er storing it
## - Set up and test the routes to access the API
## - Create a schema
## - Set up CRUD functions and error handlers
## - Test all functions of the database

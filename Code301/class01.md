## Components
> Components are a Reusable pieace of code . It makes the task of building UIs much easier. Each component exists in the same space, but they work independently from one another and merge all in a parent component, which will be the final UI of  application. 
## Characteristics of Components
- Components are usually designed to be **reused** however some components are designed for a specific task.
- Components may be freely **substituted** with other similar components. 
- Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
- designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
- depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.
- component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

## advantages of using component-based architecture
- Component-Based architecture reduces the cost of development and maintenance.
- It is reusable which means can be used to reusable components to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications.
- It increases the reliability of the whole system via reuse.
- It is easy to maintain and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.
- It modifies the complexity with the use of a component container and its services.
- If the new compatible versions are available then it is easy to replace the existing versions without any impact on the other components.
